    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A meatball is ground meat rolled into a ball, sometimes along with other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, minced onion, eggs, butter, and seasoning.
         Meatballs are cooked by frying, baking, steaming, or braising in sauce. There are many types of meatballs using different types of meats and spices.
         The term is sometimes extended to meatless versions based on vegetables or fish; the latter are also commonly known as fishballs.</p>
